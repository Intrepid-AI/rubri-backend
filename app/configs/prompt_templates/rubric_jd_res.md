You are an expert in creating comprehensive rubrics for job evaluations. Given the following job description and resume, create a detailed rubric that can be used to assess the candidate's fit for the role:

Job Description:
{job_description}

Candidate Resume:
{resume}

Please generate a rubric with the following characteristics:
1. Create 4-6 main evaluation categories relevant to the job description
2. For each category, define 3-5 specific criteria that compare the resume against job requirements
3. Provide a scoring scale from 1-5 for each criterion
4. Include a brief explanation of what each score level represents
5. Ensure the rubric is objective, measurable, and directly aligned with the job requirements
6. Highlight specific strengths and potential gaps in the candidate's profile

Output the rubric in a clear, structured JSON format that can be easily parsed and used for candidate evaluation. Include a summary section that provides an overall assessment of the candidate's potential fit for the role.
